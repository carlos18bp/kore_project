Analyze the changes I just made using the `git status` and `git diff` commands. Based on our Change Implementation Guidelines, generate a concise, professional commit message in English.

Format rules:
- Use `FEAT: [description]` if I added new tests, features, or enhancements.
- Use `FIX: [description]` if I fixed a bug or a failing test.
- Use `DOCS: [description]` if I only updated documentation (e.g., README or docstrings).

Output:
1) The exact `git add` command(s) to stage the changes.
2) The exact command: `git commit -m "[message]"` (ready to run).
